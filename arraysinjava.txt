arrays in java
datatype [] name = new datatype[size];// this is dynamically allocation in memory
for primitives memory allocation in stack and for others like objects or(complex datatyes) memory allocation in heap 
and both occurance leads to dynamically allocation 
int []arr = new int[5];
initialization is in heap and declaration in stack

//to print
for(int i: arr){
	system.out.println(i);
}
or system.out.print(Arrays.toString(arr));
 

strings are immutable 

2-d arr
int [][] numsMatrix = new int[n][m]; n for rows , m for columns ,, here rows size is mandatory columns
